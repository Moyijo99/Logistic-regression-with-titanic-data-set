# Logistic-regression-with-titanic-data-set
This project demonstrates how to implement logistic regression using the classic Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, such as age, gender, class, and fare, which will be used to predict whether they survived or not.

## Key Features:

### Data Preprocessing: 
  Cleaning the Titanic dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  Visualizations and summary statistics to understand the relationships between different features and the survival rate.
Logistic Regression Model: 
  Building a logistic regression model to predict the survival of passengers.
Model Evaluation: 
  Assessing the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
